## Build & Run
	make
	./da_proc $id $membership_file_path $n

## Remarks
    1- compile and run the program as a C program and not as a Java program. Thanks.
    2- We use ReactiveX, and some errors can be thrown when you kill the process while the PL is still trying to send messages. Don't worry about it. Thanks.
    3- Thanks.
